# Image Classification with Fashion-MNIST

This repository contains a deep learning project focused on classifying clothing items from the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

Developed as part of a university course on deep learning (DL2A), this project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to recognize fashion items such as shirts, sneakers, coats, etc.

## Project Summary

The notebook includes:

- Loading and preprocessing the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset
- Defining and training a convolutional neural network (CNN)
- Evaluating accuracy on test data
- Displaying predictions on unseen examples
- Using **TensorFlow/Keras** for all model-building operations
